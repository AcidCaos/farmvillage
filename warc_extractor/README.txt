FarmVillage Project modifications:

- Added "_main_interface function" so that the script can be easily
  called from the farmvillage server.

- Disable "duplication numbers" in extracted file names to prevent newly
  extracted assets not being seen by the server due to "(1)" being
  appended to the (typically) hash-formatted file name.
